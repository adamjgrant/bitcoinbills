I'm currently designing some denominational currency for BitCoin. Here are some of my latest drafts.

With the help of at least one other software developer, these will soon be bills you can print out as individual wallets.

Skip to the bottom to learn why I created these and what happens next.

# About the bills

Denominations of 1 and 5 times 10^x (e.g. BTC 0.001 or 0.005)
Honors great men and women of science
Fractional denominations are outlined while whole denominations are filled.
Supports encrypted keys (design for passphrase card on the way)
Will be released open-source with all original Adobe CS files.
Latin language and iconography only, every bill is universal to all languages.

Why use these?
Splitting bitcoins into separate wallets/bills ostensibly limits theft potential.
Backing up your coins is as easy as printing multiple copies.
In talks with software and device manufacturers for widespread adoption.
B&W/GreyScale versions will be released for inexpensive offline printers

I plan to release a total of 10 denominations. My next to design is the 1 BTC bill.

# Developers and Makers

I'm looking for devs and makers who want to use these designs in their projects. Get in touch with me!
